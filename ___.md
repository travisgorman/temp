Typical elitist art geek slash hacker slut. You can usually find me on my way to a unicycle pillow fight or hanging from a rock reading Infinite Jest again.

I don't expect anyone to read all this, and I'm not entirely sure what all it says in here. The last time I read it was at least a year ago, when I suddenly started getting tons of hate mail over this one line. So, I had to see what all the fuss was about. A specific phrase was causing some people to flip out. I tried to edit it, but it was perfect. No other words would work, so it was either all or nothing. I went with all. But then must have changed my mind in favor of nothing at some point because I don't get all the letters anymore.

My profile has a preface. That ought to tell you something about me. Or not. Let's do this.

~
I'm interested in everything. I like to play instruments, windy ones and stringy ones. I play outside, wander off, meander around, mosey about. If I have to go one further, Ill even frolic.

I have dreams, write compulsively, paint pictures, make friends, talk about ideas. Lately I’ve been spending a lot of time playing with JavaScript and trying to remember to stop and appreciate the physical sensation of existence.

I become enamored with beautiful new things, concepts and people everyday.

My interests start out as brief infatuations, and then subside into minor passions after they have run their course, and stay that way forever. Some stick around longer than others.

I used to have a very concrete sense of self until I realized that it was a rather stifling way to be. Now I find happiness in the idea that I am whoever and whatever I would like to be at any given moment. The world is my stage and my laboratory, and everyone is my friend. It's all just a bunch of pretty pictures and poetry, really. Life is strange.

Some things I find more fascinating than others are Fable, Allegory, Mythology, Group Theory, Doublespeak, Mentalism, Illusion, Psychology, Austrian Economics, Behavioral and Cognitive Science, Social Dynamics, Persuasion, Hypnosis, Vector Illustration, Line Art, Screen Printing, Sacred Geometry, Name Dropping, Puzzles, Riddles, Bits & Pieces.

I like idioms, cliches, literary allusions, dry humor, black comedy, open ended questions, one liners, and long winded flowery rhetoric.

Shyness and running out of things to talk about are things I can. When people used to talk about stage fright in elementary school plays, I remember the concept making no sense to me. A lot of things people do don't make sense to me.

My type is a bit absurd but in a good way.

It has been said that I can be quite sweet.
We should probably have a teaparty.

To further validate the stereotype, I wear black, drink coffee all day, wear sunglasses from the time i wake up until a bit later than necessary, and probably have at least one Kafka novel within reaching distance.

Now please, do you mind if i just get back to my original point about life, or economics and the drive towards radical self expression... or something...

I used to spend a month or two holed up in my studio, working constantly, only to look around at scattered canvases that have been worked, and overworked and painted over, and then over again...and the shit-storm of paint and debris everywhere and think, "wow, i've been working really hard, and have practically nothing of value to show for it."

You do need the typical economic system that the rest of the world participates in, where you do something, and get an expected something in return. So I turned to business, and being kind of an extremist, It turns out I'm pretty good at it.

Art is, and will always be completely subjective. For instance, take two of my favorite artists, both undeniably fire-breathing geniuses of epic proportion are Marcel Duchamp and Renne Magritte..

Margritte painted thought provok'ing and iconic juxtapositions, and Duchamp brought a toilet to the gallery, didn't even sign it, and said "this is art, go fuck yourself, sit on this and spin"...that's not a direct quote or anything, but people interpreted it like that i imagine.

And if we're harping on specifics here, it was a urinal, not a toilet, so you wouldn't want to, and probably aren't allowed to actually sit on it and spin. I said toilet instead of urinal because I hate following a vowel sound with another vowel sound. Just about every other language decided long ago that you should throw something in the middle there.

I care about things like oration, diction, annunciation, and i love me some alliteration. I also love wacky dialects like ebonics, redneck-talk, and the way cajuns talk.

You know, I am just going to stop now and do something more productive, i just realized that I went to make one simple correction on my page here and ended up going off on a goddamned diatribe.

Maybe you notice, but im not one of those guys who says three sentences and follows with "OMG, sorry for ranting and raving”.
Half the time when I start doing something, i just cant stop. Its a gift and a curse.

Besides, i hate how so many women on here say so little about themselves on their profile. If you read this far, you probably know more about me than you know about most people you actually know. The whole purpose of these profiles is to give potential dates something to riff on, to start a conversation....otherwise, they have little choice but to comment on your looks, which you hate, because you interpret it as a creepy sexual advance and think to yourself "hrmph! all guys on here are douchebags and creepers.”. It’s a vicious cycle

So, if I message you, and you didn't give me anything on your profile to work with, then YES, i am messaging you because I think you are hot and probably for no other reason.

Obviously I'm not talking about you, since you're about 743 paragraphs deep here, proving both that you can read, and that you identify with my bizarre personality enough to have read this far. So we are really just having a laugh at their expense...and I'd like to interject here to commend you on your good taste. Now, back to making fun of idiots in order to make a point about something-or-other...Oh but first, here's an important piece of social psychology: finding a common enemy is always better than liking the same thing when it comes to forming any kind of relationship etc...ponder that for a sec...its true....Oh, you like Bjork and Modest Mouse too? that's nice...Oh, you hate XY&Z, me too! instant alliance...so when i say put stuff on your profile for a guy to make conversation about, i am not talking about a list of indie bands and the obligatory 'cool kid' films.

Once upon a time, i could fall in love with a girl if she liked the right music, I'm not 15 anymore. This girl I'm kinda-sorta-maybe seeing now has completely shit taste in music and hasn't read every single Chuck Palahniuck novel, and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Nor do i feel the need to force these things upon her. It's about energy and essence man...get with it...
(but Travis, your profile is littered with references and namedropping, Yeah, but I do it with a bit more style, and besides just because I'm a hypocrite doesn't mean my point isn't valid.)

Seriously, if you think you can put 8 pictures of you doing the duckface, rocking some cleavage or whatever, and write "I'm a fun loving girl who lives life to the fullest and tee hee hee, I'm looking for mr. right,, LOL ...shoes" as your profile and are going to get actual interesting messages, you are going about the mating ritual in the wrong way. This works beautifully at a nightclub, but not on the internet. Put something on your page that's not vague as fuck so a guy can comment on something other than your tits. And seriously, if your life is that boring, they had be better spectacular.

Now that the internet is mainstream, and since the ultimate point is to create some kind of relationship with someone...how about putting a little thought into it?

Also I'd like to add, since I realize that I have gotten into some topics that may be considered "deep" or "heavy" (over the aforementioned duckface's head) I'd like to make it clear that I also like to get drunk and make out, or lounge around and be completely non-productive and lame. And I will totally make out with a duckface girl. Don't get me wrong, duckface, We can have a drink and I can dumb it down for you, and it will be fun. It probably won't go much further than that, but I'm never too busy for a good time.

Luxury, comfort and chillaxin' is serious business as far as I'm concerned. I'm a big fan of picking a show at random on Netflix and doing a marathon through every season in one or two sittings.

I tried to stop writing an hour ago….ugh….okay, i'm finished.

Seriously, if you've read this far, you might as well just go out on a date with me.
